# Redundant Files Archive

This directory contains files that were identified as redundant or non-essential but preserved for reference purposes.

## Files

- `README_MODULAR.md` - Detailed modular documentation (redundant with main README.md)
- `__init__.py` - Root level package initialization (not needed for this structure)

## Purpose

These files are kept here for:
- Reference and documentation purposes
- Potential future use if project structure changes
- Historical record of modularization process

## Note

The main functionality is preserved in the active files in the parent directory. These files can be safely ignored for normal operation but may contain useful documentation or examples.

## Removed Completely

The following were removed entirely as they can be regenerated:
- `docs/` - Empty directory
- `src/__pycache__/` - Python compiled bytecode cache

## Active Project Structure

The clean, active project structure is now in the parent directory with only essential files.
